(partially done still need to add skills and then differentiate from fortifies and resists)

need to figure out how to sort by the magnitude properly...

toggle visibility of columns that don't have any data...or with a users click to hide any column somehow..

add more rows for all the differnt effects of morrowind so you can sort by effect from best to worst

find a good way to add new items/keep it up to date


const headers = [
    'Item Name', 'Image', 'Stats', 'Hidden Effect(s)', 'Spec. Req.', 'Lvl Req.', 'Location/Boss/Event', 'Type', 'Slot', 'Other Notes', 'EV', 'Price',
    'Health', 'Magicka', 'Fatigue', 'Strength', 'Intelligence', 'Willpower', 'Agility', 'Speed', 'Endurance', 'Personality', 'Luck',
];
